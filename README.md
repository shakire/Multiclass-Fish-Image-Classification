This Project is designed to analyze fish images uploaded by users and predict the species using both CNN from scratch and Transfer Learning models.
A Streamlit Web App is developed for real-time predictions, making the solution practical and deployment-ready.

🎯 Objectives

✔ Build a robust image classifier for fish species
✔ Experiment with multiple deep learning architectures
✔ Compare results and select the best-performing model
✔ Deploy a user-friendly prediction app using Streamlit
✔ Create a reusable and scalable ML pipeline
